# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## Running the Commandline application.
Make sure you're within the ImageClassifier directory
1. At the minimum, run `python train.py flowers --gpu` to train and save the checkpoint
1. To predict the flower names and probability, run `python predict path_to_flower checkpoints/checkpoint.pth`
